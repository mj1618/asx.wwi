## 1) In-Ground Resource (MRE) Peer Valuation

This section compares WWI's in-ground resource valuation (EV per ounce) against ASX-listed gold peers at various stages.

### WWI Current Metrics

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Enterprise Value (proxy)** | ~A$348m | Market cap A$352m + debt A$19m − cash A$22m |
| **Global JORC Resource** | 7.244Moz @ 4.0g/t | WBP total (Feb 2026 update) |
| **Attributable Resource (74%)** | 5.36Moz | 0.74 × 7.244Moz |
| **DFS Ore Reserve** | 0.384Moz | Qala Shallows (Jul 2025 DFS) |
| **Attributable Reserve (74%)** | 0.284Moz | 0.74 × 0.384Moz |
| **EV/oz (Attributable Resource)** | **A$65/oz** | A$348m ÷ 5.36Moz |
| **EV/oz (Attributable Reserve)** | **A$1,225/oz** | A$348m ÷ 0.284Moz |

### Peer Comparison: EV per Ounce of Resource

| Ticker | Company | Stage | Jurisdiction | EV/oz (Resource) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **TGM** | Theta Gold Mines | Developer | South Africa | **A$36/oz** | Closest jurisdiction comp; FS retracted |
| **WWI** | West Wits Mining | Developer | South Africa | **A$65/oz** | First gold Mar 2026 |
| **STN** | Saturn Metals | Developer | WA | A$111/oz | Low-grade heap leach |
| **WAF** | West African Resources | Producer | Burkina Faso | A$330/oz | SSA producer |
| **GMD** | Genesis Minerals | Developer/Producer | WA | A$336/oz | Consolidation play |
| **MEK** | Meeka Metals | Developer/Producer | WA | A$577/oz | First gold Jul 2025 |
| **RMS** | Ramelius Resources | Producer | WA | A$758/oz | Multi-asset producer |
| **BGL** | Bellevue Gold | Producer | WA | A$883/oz | High-grade underground |
| **CMM** | Capricorn Metals | Producer | WA | A$1,023/oz | Karlawinda producer |
| **PRU** | Perseus Mining | Producer | West Africa | A$1,046/oz | Multi-mine, self-funding |

### What the Peer Comparison Implies

1. **Developer Discount**: WWI trades at A$65/oz — well below Australian developers (A$111–577/oz) and dramatically below producers (A$330–1,046/oz).

2. **Jurisdiction Discount**: The only peer trading cheaper than WWI on EV/oz is TGM (A$36/oz), another South African developer. This reflects the "SA developer" discount.

3. **Re-rating Potential**: If WWI successfully transitions to producer status:
   - Moving to **WAF-like** multiples (A$330/oz) implies EV of ~A$1.8bn (5× current)
   - Moving to **mid-tier producer** multiples (A$500/oz) implies EV of ~A$2.7bn (8× current)
   - Even a modest re-rate to A$150/oz implies EV of ~A$800m (2.3× current)

4. **Caution on Resource-Based Multiples**: EV/oz is most meaningful for *convertible* ounces. WWI's 7.24Moz includes 3.23Moz of Inferred resources; the market is rightly discounting conversion risk.

## 2) Production Ramp-Up Assumptions

Based on the DFS target of ~70,000oz p.a. steady-state and first gold pour in March 2026:

| Period | Calendar | Production (oz) | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Year 1** | Mar 2026 – Feb 2027 | ~25,000oz | 10 months production, commissioning + ramp |
| **Year 2** | Mar 2027 – Feb 2028 | ~55,000oz | Near steady-state, full year |
| **Year 3** | Mar 2028 – Feb 2029 | ~70,000oz | Full steady-state achieved |

### Key Model Inputs

| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Gold Price** | US$4,800/oz | Current spot (late Jan 2026) |
| **AISC** | US$1,289/oz | Qala Shallows DFS (Jul 2025) |
| **Margin per oz** | US$3,511/oz | Gold price − AISC |
| **WWI Ownership** | 74% | WBP attributable interest |
| **FX Rate** | AUD/USD 0.70 | USD→AUD multiply by 1.43 |
| **Basic Shares** | 4.32B | As at Jan 2026 |
| **Fully Diluted Shares** | ~5.0B | Includes options/warrants/CNs |

---

## 3) Forward Valuation: Cash Flow Approach

This approach values WWI based on projected operating cash flows, applying producer-like EV/EBITDA multiples.

### Attributable Operating Cash Flow Projection

\[
\text{Attrib. OCF} = \text{Production (oz)} \times \text{Margin} \times 74\%
\]

| Year | Production | Margin (US$/oz) | Attrib. OCF (US$m) | Attrib. OCF (A$m) |
|------|------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Year 1** | 25,000oz | $3,511 | $65m | **A$93m** |
| **Year 2** | 55,000oz | $3,511 | $143m | **A$204m** |
| **Year 3** | 70,000oz | $3,511 | $182m | **A$260m** |

### Implied Valuation at Producer Multiples

Small-cap gold producers typically trade at 4–6× EV/EBITDA (with quality operators commanding the higher end).

| Year | Cash Flow (A$m) | 4× Multiple | 5× Multiple | 6× Multiple |
|------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Year 1** | 93 | A$372m | A$465m | A$558m |
| **Year 2** | 204 | A$816m | A$1,020m | A$1,224m |
| **Year 3** | 260 | A$1,040m | A$1,300m | A$1,560m |

### Per-Share Valuation (Cash Flow Approach)

Using ~5.0B fully diluted shares:

| Year | Low (4×) | Mid (5×) | High (6×) |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Year 1** | A$0.07 | A$0.09 | A$0.11 |
| **Year 2** | A$0.16 | A$0.20 | A$0.24 |
| **Year 3** | A$0.21 | A$0.26 | A$0.31 |

## 4) Forward Valuation: NPV Re-rating Approach

This approach starts with the DFS NPV and adjusts for:
1. Current gold price (vs DFS assumptions)
2. Risk discount that narrows as milestones clear

### Step 1: Re-rate DFS NPV for Current Gold Price

The Qala Shallows DFS (Jul 2025) provides gold price sensitivity:

| Gold Price (US$/oz) | Post-Tax NPV7.5 (US$m) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| $1,850 | $194m |
| $2,350 | $347m |
| $2,850 | $500m (base case) |
| $3,850 | $806m |
| $4,850 | $1,111m |

At **US$4,800/oz** (current spot), interpolating gives:

\[
\text{Re-rated NPV} \approx \text{US\$1,085m} \approx \text{A\$1,550m}
\]

**Attributable NPV (74%)**: ~A$1,150m

### Step 2: Apply Risk-Adjusted Discount to NPV

Pre-production developers typically trade at 30–50% of NPV. As milestones clear, the discount narrows:

| Year | Risk Profile | Discount to NPV | Implied EV (A$m) |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Year 1** | Developer / First Gold Risk | 60–75% | **A$290–460m** |
| **Year 2** | Ramping Producer | 40–55% | **A$520–690m** |
| **Year 3** | Established Producer | 25–40% | **A$690–860m** |

### Per-Share Valuation (NPV Re-rating Approach)

Using ~5.0B fully diluted shares:

| Year | Low | Mid | High |
|------|-----|-----|------|
| **Year 1** | A$0.06 | A$0.08 | A$0.09 |
| **Year 2** | A$0.10 | A$0.12 | A$0.14 |
| **Year 3** | A$0.14 | A$0.16 | A$0.17 |

## 5) Triangulated Valuation Summary

Combining both approaches (cash flow and NPV re-rating):

| Horizon | Low (A$/sh) | Mid (A$/sh) | High (A$/sh) | Current Price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Today** | — | — | — | **A$0.077** |
| **Year 1** (Feb 2027) | A$0.06 | A$0.09 | A$0.11 | — |
| **Year 2** (Feb 2028) | A$0.13 | A$0.16 | A$0.19 | — |
| **Year 3** (Feb 2029) | A$0.17 | A$0.21 | A$0.24 | — |

### Implied Upside / Downside

| Horizon | Downside Risk | Base Case Upside | Bull Case Upside |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Year 1** | −22% | +17% | +43% |
| **Year 2** | +69% | +108% | +147% |
| **Year 3** | +121% | +173% | +212% |

## 6) Gold Price Sensitivity

The valuation is highly sensitive to gold price. Here's the Year 3 steady-state valuation at different gold prices:

| Gold Price (US$/oz) | Margin (US$/oz) | Year 3 Cash Flow (A$m) | EV @ 5× (A$m) | Per Share (FD) |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **$2,850** (DFS base) | $1,561 | $116m | A$580m | A$0.12 |
| **$3,500** | $2,211 | $164m | A$820m | A$0.16 |
| **$4,000** | $2,711 | $202m | A$1,010m | A$0.20 |
| **$4,500** | $3,211 | $239m | A$1,195m | A$0.24 |
| **$4,800** (current) | $3,511 | $261m | A$1,305m | A$0.26 |
| **$5,500** | $4,211 | $313m | A$1,565m | A$0.31 |

---

## 7) Dilution Sensitivity

Dilution is a first-order risk. Scenarios at Year 3 (mid-case EV of ~A$1,040m):

| Share Count Scenario | Shares (B) | Value/Share |
|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| Current FD | 5.0B | A$0.21 |
| +20% dilution | 6.0B | A$0.17 |
| +40% dilution | 7.0B | A$0.15 |
| +60% dilution | 8.0B | A$0.13 |
| +100% dilution | 10.0B | A$0.10 |

**Key insight**: Even with 60% additional dilution, the Year 3 per-share value (A$0.13) is above today's price if execution proceeds.

## 8) Key Assumptions & Caveats

### What Must Go Right for These Valuations

1. **First gold on schedule** (March 2026) — any material delay compresses Year 1 production and cash flow
2. **Ramp proceeds to plan** — underground mining ramp-ups frequently face challenges (grade, throughput, safety)
3. **Costs track DFS** — AISC of US$1,289/oz must be achieved; inflation/FX can erode margins
4. **Gold price stays elevated** — valuations are highly levered to gold; a return to US$2,850/oz cuts Year 3 value by ~55%
5. **Limited incremental dilution** — per-share outcomes depend on funding discipline through the ramp

### What Could Go Wrong

- First gold delayed to H2 2026 or beyond
- Grade/recovery reconciliation issues vs DFS
- Cost blowouts (labour, consumables, power)
- Toll-treatment execution risk (Sibanye-Stillwater plant)
- Further discounted equity raises during ramp
- Gold price correction
- South Africa regulatory / community issues

### What This Analysis Does NOT Include

- Tax effects (model uses pre-tax operating cash flow as proxy)
- Sustaining capex (treated as embedded in AISC)
- Corporate G&A allocation
- Debt service / interest costs
- Mt Cecilia optionality value
- Project 200 expansion upside
