# ASX:WWI (West Wits Mining Limited) — “Wall Street-style” deep-dive report

*As-of date: **2026-02-02** (unless stated otherwise)*  
*Not financial advice. This is a synthesis of public information with explicit assumptions and uncertainty ranges.*

## Executive summary (one page)

### What WWI is (and what it owns)
West Wits Mining Limited (“WWI”) is an Australia-listed micro-/small-cap gold developer transitioning into an early producer, with its flagship asset in South Africa:

- **Flagship**: **Witwatersrand Basin Project (WBP)** in Gauteng, South Africa — includes **Qala Shallows** underground gold mine development (near-term production pathway).
  - WWI reports **74%** interest in WBP tenements (local minority partner holds 26%).  
  - WBP global JORC (2012) **Mineral Resource Estimate** updated to **7.24Moz @ 4.0 g/t Au** (includes Inferred).  
  - Qala Shallows DFS (updated) headline economics include **post‑tax NPV7.5 = US$500m** (base case “All Mineral Resources”; includes Inferred), **IRR 81%**, **AISC US$1,289/oz**, **peak funding US$44m**.  

Non-core/optionality:
- **Mt Cecilia (WA, Australia)**: 100% held exploration (Paterson Province); Rio Tinto farm-in rights lapsed in Dec 2025 per WWI.  
- **Derewo (Indonesia)**: legacy, minority interests; WWI describes it as dormant/divestment and flags tenure/compliance risk for exploration IUPs.

**Primary sources** (key claims above):
- WBP/Qala status + ownership + first gold target: **WWI quarterly (Dec 2025)** — 2026-01-23 (see `announcements.md` / `sources.md`).  
- Global MRE update: **WBP JORC MRE announcement** — 2026-02-02 (see `announcements.md` / `sources.md`).  
- DFS economics anchor: **Qala Shallows DFS update** — 2025-07-23 (see `sources.md`).  

### What the market is pricing (snapshot)
This repo’s working snapshot (secondary market data) frames WWI as a “rerate candidate” into first gold:

- **Share price**: ~A$0.077 (Google Finance snapshot, 2026-02-02)  
- **Market cap**: ~A$351.6m (Google Finance snapshot, 2026-02-02)  
- **Basic shares**: 4,319,419,767 (ASX Appendix 2A, 2026-01-27)  
- **Selected dilutive instruments (counts, 2026-01-27)**: quoted options 319.6m; unquoted options 171.1m; unquoted warrants 166.9m; performance rights 5.0m; (convertible notes also exist; conversion not fully modelled in the simple tally).  

### The 5–10 most important things to know (facts + implications)
- **Production transition is the whole story for the next ~12–24 months**: WWI’s near-term rerate (or de-rate) is dominated by **first gold + ramp execution**, not by the headline 7.24Moz resource. (Quarterly 2026-01-23; MRE 2026-02-02)
- **Headline DFS economics are large, but “All Resources” includes Inferred**: treating DFS NPV as “equity value” without haircuts is misleading; the market will discount until ramp performance and funding path are proven. (DFS 2025-07-23; valuation framing in `valuation.md`)
- **Cap structure + dilution are first-class drivers**: WWI has a very large share count and meaningful option/warrant stack; per-share upside depends as much on **avoiding distressed funding** as on project value. (Appendix 2A 2026-01-27; `valuation.md`)
- **Runway is not “set-and-forget”**: as of 31 Dec 2025 WWI reported **A$22.246m cash** with **A$18.653m** drawn loan facilities and reported **2.64 quarters** of funding available (Appendix 5B). If ramp is delayed/bumpy, dilution risk rises quickly. (Quarterly + Appendix 5B 2026-01-23)
- **South Africa adds a persistent “jurisdiction + execution” discount**: even good assets can trade cheap until operating proof is visible, and governance/structure complexity can amplify the discount. (peer framing in `peers.md`)
- **Governance optics matter because WWI is capital-markets dependent**: related-party payments and incentive issuance are not automatically “bad”, but they can raise cost of capital and compress valuation if they trend higher or are poorly explained. (FY2025 annual report; Appendix 5B item 6, 2026-01-23)
- **The 7.24Moz resource is real optionality — but the market will pay for reserves and cashflow**: reserve-based multiples can look expensive even if resource-based multiples look cheap. This is not a contradiction; it’s the market pricing “convertibility”. (`peers.md`; `valuation.md`)
- **There are credible near-term catalysts** (first gold target Mar 2026; stockpiling and toll-treatment pathway referenced), but small timing slips can matter disproportionately in a high-share-count, high-burn ramp window. (Quarterly 2026-01-23)

### Price view: ranges + probabilities (explicit)
WWI is best framed as a **milestone-driven, distribution-of-outcomes** stock.

- **Bull (25%)**: A$0.14–A$0.22  
- **Base (50%)**: A$0.06–A$0.11  
- **Bear (25%)**: A$0.01–A$0.04  

These are **range “price targets”** (not point estimates) derived from a discounted/risked interpretation of the DFS anchor and explicit dilution bands; see `valuation.md` and scenario table in `ANALYSIS.md`.

**2-year downside probability (chance the stock doesn’t go up / goes down): ~35–45%**.  
Rationale: the next 24 months are dominated by first-gold/ramp + funding path; even with “some” operational success, per-share returns can be muted or negative if dilution dominates.

## Business + assets (what matters, what’s unknown)

### WBP / Qala Shallows (flagship; value driver)
**Where the value is:** Qala Shallows is the near-term transition asset that can convert WWI from “developer” to “producer.” The company’s own targets include:
- **First gold pour target: Mar 2026** (linked to ore delivery/stockpiling and toll processing plan).  
- A steady-state target referenced by the company: **~70koz p.a.** (forward-looking target; must be proven via ramp data).  

**What’s gating / unknown (investor lens):**
- **Ramp execution and grade reconciliation**: early production is where many mines fail to meet plan (grade, dilution, mining rates).
- **Toll treatment dependency**: timing and performance are tied to the toll-processing pathway at Ezulwini (operational + commercial frictions can slip schedules).
- **Cost control**: the DFS headline AISC is a helpful anchor, but realised costs can deviate materially during commissioning/ramp.
- **Funding path**: “peak funding” in a study is not the same as real-world funding, especially if time slips or working capital needs expand.

**Primary sources**: 2026-01-23 quarterly + Appendix 5B; 2026-02-02 resource update; 2025-07-23 DFS update (see `announcements.md` / `sources.md`).

### Mt Cecilia (optionality; WA exploration)
**How to frame it:** this is genuine exploration optionality, but it should not dominate an investment case while WWI is executing a mine build/ramp in South Africa.

**Watch items:**
- Whether WWI self-funds drilling (dilution risk) vs partners/divests.
- Evidence of a system large enough to matter (not just isolated intercepts).

**Primary source**: 2026-01-23 quarterly (Rio farm-in lapse; work program notes).

### Derewo (legacy; divestment / write-off risk)
WWI describes Derewo as non-core, with no substantive activity, and highlights the risk that some exploration IUPs may be outside compliance periods and subject to cancellation.

**How to frame it:** assume **minimal value** unless/until WWI demonstrates a credible divestment outcome or renewed, compliant progress.

**Primary source**: 2026-01-23 quarterly (Derewo interest percentages and tenure/compliance risk flag).

---

## Financing + dilution (what “success” looks like financially)

### Current runway framing (from latest captured quarter)
As at **31 Dec 2025**, WWI reported:
- **Cash**: **A$22.246m**
- **Loan facilities drawn**: **A$18.653m**
- **Estimated quarters of funding available**: **2.64 quarters** (company-reported in Appendix 5B)

**Primary source**: 2026-01-23 quarterly + Appendix 5B (see `announcements.md` / `sources.md`).

### Why dilution risk is structurally high
WWI’s capital structure is already large on a per-share basis:
- **Basic shares** (2026-01-27): **4.319b**
- **Simple “fully diluted ex-convertibles”** (adds options/warrants/perf rights counts): ~**4.982b** (see `valuation.md`)

Recent raises have been large and frequent (examples captured in `announcements.md`):
- 2025-09-15: **A$17.5m** placement @ **A$0.04**
- 2026-01-20 / 2026-01-22: placement **upsized to A$33.74m** @ **A$0.08**, with **free-attaching unlisted options** (exercise A$0.11, 3-year expiry)

**Investor implication:** per-share outcomes are a function of both (a) operational success and (b) whether WWI can fund the ramp/working capital **without repeated discounted placements**.

### What “success” looks like from a funding perspective (next ~12–24 months)
- **Best case**: first gold and ramp progress reduce burn and allow funding via a mix of operating cash + non-distressed options exercise/strategic capital (less punitive per-share dilution).
- **Failure mode**: ramp delays + continued high burn forces equity at lower prices and/or lender-driven dilution features (warrants, restructures), dominating per-share returns even if the asset is “good”.

---

## Management, governance + alignment (high-signal positives and red flags)

### What looks directionally positive (evidence-based)
- **Management incentives are tied to operational milestones** (e.g., production-rate and annualised production targets are referenced in the annual report incentive disclosures), which is aligned with the near-term value driver: ramp execution.
- **Directors have participated in placements** (e.g., 2025 placement participation disclosed in director interest notices), which is a modest “skin in the game” signal (though small relative to the overall share count).

**Primary sources**: FY2025 annual report; director interest notices cited in `ownership.md` / `sources.md`.

### What to monitor closely (red flags / trust & cost-of-capital risks)
- **Related-party payments are non-trivial** and recur (e.g., Appendix 5B item 6 shows related-party payments; the FY2025 annual report discloses related-party transactions with director-related entities). This doesn’t prove wrongdoing; it does increase governance scrutiny and can increase the market’s discount rate.
- **Ongoing incentive issuance** adds to cap-structure overhang; investors should track Appendix 2A/3G cadence and any strike resets/extensions.
- **Executive Chair structure** concentrates influence; in small caps this can be helpful for speed, but increases key-person and governance optics risk.

**Primary sources**: FY2025 annual report; 2026-01-23 Appendix 5B; 2026-01-27 Appendix 2A; 2026-01-28 Appendix 3G (all referenced in `sources.md`).

## Valuation & scenarios (ranges, not precision theatre)

### Anchor: DFS economics (then haircut + dilution)
This repo’s valuation framing intentionally:
- starts from the **DFS post-tax NPV7.5** anchor (and its sensitivities),
- adjusts for **WWI’s interest (74%)** and a transparent USD→AUD conversion,
- applies **wide discount-to-NPV haircuts** based on de-risking state,
- and models **share count expansion** as a first-order driver of per-share outcomes.

See `valuation.md` for the auditable math and `ANALYSIS.md` for the scenario table and the probability-weighted framing.

### Scenario outcomes (2-year investor framing)
- **Bull (25%)**: on-time first gold + clean ramp; market rerates toward a lower discount-to-NPV; dilution remains moderate. **A$0.14–A$0.22**
- **Base (50%)**: first gold achieved, ramp is bumpy, funding continues to matter; valuation converges partially to DFS anchor but diluted share count caps per-share upside. **A$0.06–A$0.11**
- **Bear (25%)**: delays/underperformance force stressed funding; dilution dominates and market prices WWI as a distressed developer. **A$0.01–A$0.04**

### Explicit 2-year downside probability
**~35–45%** chance the stock does not go up over the next couple of years (and may go down), driven by the interaction between:
- schedule/ramp risk, and
- funding/dilution path.

**What would change this probability (leading indicators):**
- Strong: first gold achieved + early quarters show improving unit economics and cash burn compression.
- Weak: repeated placement announcements, widening discount to last price, deteriorating runway, or missed ramp milestones.

## Peer comps cross-check (conclusions only; tables live elsewhere)
See `peers.md` for the full comps table and sources. The highest-signal cross-check conclusions:

- **WWI can look “cheap” on EV/resource-ounce**, but that mostly measures the market’s skepticism about converting ounces into reserves and cashflow.
- **WWI looks far less “cheap” on EV/reserve-ounce**, which aligns with the market paying for near-term mineable ounces, not the 7.24Moz story yet.
- **South Africa developers can trade at very low multiples until financing + operating proof is clear**; WWI is competing against “self-funding producers” for capital, so governance and dilution discipline matter.
- **The most investable rerate trigger is operational proof**, not another resource headline: first gold + stable ramp.

## Catalysts + what to monitor (practical watchlist)

For a repeatable “update protocol” (what to check, how often, and where to record deltas), see `monitoring.md`.

### Near-term catalysts (0–6 months)
- **First gold / initial processing** (target: **Mar 2026**) and evidence of consistent ore deliveries (quarterly updates).
- Updates on toll-treatment operations and any schedule or commercial changes.

### Medium-term (6–24 months)
- Evidence of a credible ramp trajectory toward the company-stated steady-state target.
- Any expansion framing (e.g., “Project 200”) that is funded without punishing dilution.
- Mt Cecilia partnering/field season outcome (only if it can be funded sensibly).

### Quarterly “dashboard” (what to track every Appendix 5B / quarterly)
- **Cash balance** and **net operating + investing cash outflows**
- **Estimated quarters of funding available** (Appendix 5B item 8.7)
- **Financing facility movements** and any new equity-linked instruments
- **Related-party payments** (Appendix 5B item 6) and narrative breakdown
- **Share count + new option/warrant issuance** (Appendix 2A/3B/3G cadence)
