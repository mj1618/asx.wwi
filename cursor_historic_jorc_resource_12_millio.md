There is talk of a historic resource under an old JORC code of about 12 million ounces.

Can you find it in any company announcements and give me a summary? may need to go back a fair way.

**Cursor**

I'll look into the existing files to understand the company and then search for information about the historic 12 million ounce resource.

The current JORC (2012) resource is 7.24Moz, but you're asking about a much larger historic figure. The Witwatersrand Basin is a historically prolific gold region, so there's likely reference to a historic/foreign resource estimate. Let me search for this.

I found it. The historic resource was declared by **DRD Gold (the previous owner) as a 12.8 million ounce JORC (1997) resource in 2000**. Let me get more details on this.

I found the key information. Let me search for any West Wits company announcements that reference this historic resource.

I have all the key information now. Here's the summary:

## Historic Resource Summary: 12.8Moz under JORC (1997)

**What it is:**
- **DRD Gold** (the previous owner of the Witwatersrand Basin mining area) declared a **12.8 million ounce gold resource under JORC (1997) code in the year 2000**.
- This is a "historic" or "foreign" resource estimate because it was prepared under the old 1997 JORC code, not the current 2012 code.

**Why it matters:**
- This historic figure represents the total gold endowment that was identified in the area before West Wits acquired it.
- West Wits' strategic exploration objective has been **converting DRD's historical 12.8Moz resource into modern JORC (2012) compliant estimates**.

**Conversion progress:**
| Date | JORC (2012) Resource | % of Historic Converted |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Jan 2016 | 1.34Moz (maiden) | ~10% |
| Oct 2020 | 4.37Moz @ 3.88g/t | ~34% |
| Feb 2026 | **7.24Moz @ 4.0g/t** | **~57%** |

**Key caveats:**
1. The historic 12.8Moz figure **cannot be directly relied upon** for investment purposes — it doesn't comply with current JORC (2012) reporting standards.
2. Not all of the historic resource may be economically mineable. West Wits has focused on areas **above 400m depth** (or above 1,500m where engineering allows dry access via water pillars).
3. The current 7.24Moz JORC (2012) resource represents what has been verified to modern standards, with ~4.0Moz in Measured & Indicated categories.

**Source:**
The reference to DRD Gold's 12.8Moz JORC (1997) resource appears in various West Wits investor presentations and resource announcements as historical context. The SmallCaps article from October 2020 explicitly states: *"DRD Gold, the previous owners of this mining area, declared a 12.8Moz JORC (1997) resource in 2000."*

In essence, the ~12 million ounce figure you've heard about is real and documented — it's the legacy resource from DRD Gold's era. West Wits has been progressively proving up this inventory under modern JORC standards, and at 7.24Moz they've converted roughly half of it so far, with the potential for more as they continue drilling and extend into additional reef areas.
