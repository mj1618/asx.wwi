## Goal

Fill the missing “who is running this + are incentives aligned + are there governance red flags?” parts of the WWI deep dive, in a way that is **traceable to primary filings** and directly useful for the README’s risk/upside questions.

## Deliverables completed

1. Updated `ANALYSIS.md`:
   - Populated **10) Management, governance, and alignment** with:
     - a table of key people (roles, appointment notes, investor relevance)
     - an alignment summary (director/KMP interests; incentive structure; director placement participation)
     - a filing-supported governance watchlist (related-party payments/transactions; incentive overhang; watch items)
   - Expanded **11) Risk register** with governance/alignment risks and leading indicators.
   - Updated **1) Company snapshot** major-holder placeholder with Top-20 concentration + disclosed substantial holder (dated).

2. Updated `sources.md`:
   - Added the FY2025 Annual Report as the primary source for board/management roster, director interests, remuneration structure, related-party disclosures, and top-20/shareholder concentration.
   - Added explicit governance/related-party sources (Quarterly + Appendix 5B, Appendix 2A, Appendix 3G).

## Primary sources used

- FY2025 Annual Report (year ended 30 June 2025)
- Quarterly Activity Report + Appendix 5B (quarter ended 31 Dec 2025)
- Appendix 2A (post-placement capital snapshot)
- Appendix 3G (unquoted option issue under incentive scheme)

## Completion notes (2026-02-02)

- Extracted the board + management roster, appointment dates, and director/KMP interests from the FY2025 Annual Report.
- Quantified and documented the governance “watchlist” using filing-supported related-party disclosures (annual report notes + Appendix 5B item 6) and highlighted leading indicators to monitor going forward.
