## Task: Build initial ASX:WWI deep-dive outline + source checklist

### Goal
Create a structured “Wall Street-style” research outline for ASX:WWI (West Wits Mining Limited) that we can iteratively fill in, and define the minimum set of primary sources we must pull (ASX announcements, quarterly reports, investor presentations, director filings, etc.).

### Why
`README.md` asks for a full deep-dive (financials, news, comps, management, risks, upside, scenarios). We need a rigorous outline + source plan before writing analysis.

### Deliverables
- Create/replace `ANALYSIS.md` with:
  - Company snapshot (what it does, key assets/projects, jurisdictions)
  - Investment thesis (bull/base/bear)
  - Key catalysts + timeline (next 6/12/24 months)
  - Financial overview framework (cash, burn, funding needs, dilution risk)
  - Valuation approaches to use (peer comps, NAV/DCF-style mining heuristics)
  - Risk register (permits, commodity, jurisdiction, financing, execution)
  - Scenario table template (probabilities, outcomes, price targets)
  - “Open questions” list (what we must verify)
- Add a `sources.md` (or section in `ANALYSIS.md`) listing primary sources to fetch:
  - ASX announcements (last 24 months)
  - Latest quarterly/annual reports
  - Investor deck / presentations
  - Corporate governance / director/shareholder info
  - Relevant JV/asset documentation if available
  - Commodity price assumptions references

### Constraints / Notes
- Prefer primary sources over blogs/forums.
- Track citations clearly (link + date + what claim it supports).
- Keep it concise and structured; we’ll expand later with real numbers.

### Dependencies
None.

### Completion notes
Completed on 2026-02-02.

- Created `ANALYSIS.md` as a structured, Wall-Street-style deep-dive outline with templates for: snapshot, thesis (bull/base/bear), catalysts timeline, financial/runway framework, valuation lenses, risk register, scenario table, and open questions.
- Added `sources.md` with a primary-source checklist (ASX announcements, financials, technical docs, governance/ownership, reference market data) and a consistent citation format.
