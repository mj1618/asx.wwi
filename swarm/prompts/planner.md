# Read the plan

See @README.md and @PLAN.md

# Find the next logical task

Look through the @PLAN.md file and the repo in general and find the next thing to do. Don't duplicate what's already in ./swarm/todo/

# Write a task file

Then plan out the task and write it to ./swarm/todo/{task-name}.pending.md
Use a sequential number in the name so that it's clear which tasks come first.

Also update @PLAN.md appropriately if you find that it requires new information.

# Exit condition

If you fail to find something, or if you've successfully written a single task - exit immediately.
