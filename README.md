# ASX WWI deep dive

I'm planning to invest a large amount in ASX.WWWI (West Wits Mining Limited).

I want you to do a deep dive review like a proper wall street analyst would do.

Look at everything you can find, like:
- financials
- news articles
- similar companies and compare
- management team
- risks
- upside

And tell me what the most important things are to know. I also want to know your prediction of the price going forward, and what is the chance that the stock will not go up in the next couple of years and may go down. I want to know the likelihood of these different outcomes.
