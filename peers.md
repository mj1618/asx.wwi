# Peer comps + relative valuation — ASX:WWI (West Wits Mining)

> Not financial advice. Working notes intended to be **directional**, not "precision theatre".

---

## Selection Criteria (based on WWI's profile)

- Gold developers or early-stage producers
- Similar market cap range or development stage
- African jurisdiction exposure (like WWI's South Africa focus) OR Australian developers
- Near-term production catalysts (2025-2027 first gold targets)
- Similar resource/reserve profiles

---

## Method + caveats

### Market cap / EV snapshot (secondary)
- **Market cap source**: TradingView "Key stats" **market capitalisation** for each ticker — *as-of 2026-02-02* (secondary market-data snapshot).
- **EV**: where **net cash / net debt** was not readily available from a primary filing within this task, EV is shown as an **EV proxy** (\(\approx\) market cap). If net cash / debt is available, EV proxy adjusts for it.

### Technical metrics (prefer primary)
- For **resources/reserves/grades**, prefer **JORC / annual report / ASX announcement PDFs**.
- For **study economics (NPV/IRR/AISC)**, prefer **ASX technical releases**; company website summaries are used where primary docs were inaccessible in-session.

### "Apples-to-apples" warnings (read before using multiples)
- **EV/oz (Resource)** is highly sensitive to **resource quality** (category, depth, metallurgy, mining method, strip ratio, recovery, capex intensity) and is often **misleading** across different deposit styles.
- **EV/oz (Reserve)** is more "apples-to-apples" but still sensitive to **margin** (AISC), **mine life**, and **jurisdiction discount**.
- **EV/NPV** is only comparable when the **discount rate, gold price deck, ownership %, and included resource categories** are aligned. Treat cross-company EV/NPV as a **rough** triangulation only.

## Rankings

### Rank 1: Most Undervalued (EV/NPV - lower = cheaper)

Companies with completed feasibility studies where we can compare market cap to NPV:

| Rank | Ticker | EV/NPV | NPV | Market Cap | Why Cheap/Expensive |
|------|--------|--------|-----|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **TGM** | ~0.16x | A$785m | A$123m | SA jurisdiction + FS retraction risk |
| 2 | **AUC** | ~0.20x | A$954m | A$187m | Pre-construction, funding needed |
| 3 | **PDI** | ~0.38x | A$2.5bn | A$950m | Guinea risk + merger complexity |
| 4 | **WWI** | ~0.45x | A$780m | A$350m | SA risk + execution imminent |
| 5 | **MEK** | ~0.55x | A$616m | A$340m | Already producing, less upside |

**Key insight:** TGM and AUC trade at biggest discounts to NPV, but TGM has a retracted feasibility study (reliability concerns) while AUC has a clean DFS with Australian jurisdiction.

---

### Rank 2: Largest Upside Potential

Considering: gap to NPV, catalyst proximity, resource scale, and expansion optionality.

| Rank | Ticker | Upside Thesis | Near-Term Catalyst | Risk-Adjusted View |
|------|--------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **TGM** | 6x+ to NPV if executes | Q1 2027 first gold | HIGH RISK - FS retracted |
| 2 | **AUC** | 5x to NPV, clean study | Late 2027 first gold | MEDIUM - needs funding |
| 3 | **PDI** | 2.5x to NPV, scale | Merger completion | MEDIUM - Guinea |
| 4 | **WWI** | 2x+ to NPV | First gold Mar 2026 | MEDIUM-HIGH - SA + dilution |
| 5 | **TCG** | Resource growth + permit | PFS/DFS catalyst | MEDIUM - no NPV yet |
| 6 | **AUE** | Resource growth story | PFS Q1 2026 | MEDIUM - early stage |
| 7 | **MEK** | Ramp execution | Production ramp | LOWER - less gap |
| 8 | **STN** | PFS de-risking | PFS release | MEDIUM - early stage |
| 9 | **TIE** | Steady producer growth | APG second mine | LOWER - already valued |
| 10 | **CYL** | Growth to 200koz | Execution | LOWEST - mature |

**Key insight:** The largest absolute upside is in the most discounted names (TGM, AUC), but risk-adjusted upside favors PDI and WWI which have clearer near-term catalysts and institutional support.

---

### Rank 3: Lowest Risk (most de-risked to least)

| Rank | Ticker | Risk Level | Key Risk Factors | De-Risking Evidence |
|------|--------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **CYL** | LOWEST | Execution only | Already producing 100koz p.a., cash generating, Australian |
| 2 | **TIE** | LOW | Ramp, Côte d'Ivoire | Producing, debt-free, unhedged, ramping well |
| 3 | **MEK** | LOW-MED | Early ramp | Just started producing, Australian jurisdiction |
| 4 | **LSX** | LOW-MED | Portfolio risk | Diversified, professional management, ~12% discount to NAV |
| 5 | **AUC** | MEDIUM | Funding, construction | Clean DFS, Australian, but needs A$355m capex |
| 6 | **PDI** | MEDIUM | Guinea, merger | DFS complete, institutional backing (Lundin, Zijin) |
| 7 | **STN** | MEDIUM | Early stage | PFS pending, Australian, trading halted |
| 8 | **AUE** | MED-HIGH | Early stage | Pre-PFS, Côte d'Ivoire, well-funded |
| 9 | **TCG** | MED-HIGH | No study yet | Permit granted but no economics published |
| 10 | **WWI** | HIGH | SA, execution, dilution | First gold imminent but SA risk + large share count |
| 11 | **TGM** | HIGHEST | SA, FS retracted | FS retraction warning, SA jurisdiction, BEE complexity |

**Key insight:** Producers (CYL, TIE, MEK) are lowest risk. Australian developers (AUC, STN) are medium risk. African developers (PDI, TCG, AUE) are medium-high. South African developers (WWI, TGM) carry highest risk due to jurisdiction + governance complexity.

### Balanced Risk/Reward

1. **AUC** - 5x upside with clean Australian DFS, lower execution risk
2. **PDI** - Large scale project with institutional backing, merger catalyst

### Conservative/De-Risked

1. **TIE** - Producing, ramping, debt-free West African producer
2. **CYL** - Cash-generating Australian producer at 7.7x P/E

### Diversified Exposure

1. **LSX** - Professional gold junior portfolio at 12% discount to NAV

## Comparison Lenses

### By Jurisdiction Risk (highest to lowest discount)

1. **High risk:** TGM, WWI (South Africa - BEE, regulatory)
2. **Medium risk:** PDI (Guinea), TCG/TIE/AUE (Côte d'Ivoire)
3. **Lower risk:** MEK, AUC, STN, CYL (Australia)

### By Development Stage (earliest to latest)

1. **Producing:** CYL, TIE, MEK
2. **First gold 2026:** WWI
3. **First gold 2027:** TGM, AUC, PDI (post-merger)
4. **PFS/pre-construction:** AUE, STN, TCG

### By Dilution/Cap-Structure

- **Serial raisers (like WWI):** TGM, MEK
- **Well-funded/self-funding:** CYL, TIE, PDI (post-merger)

---

## Takeaways for WWI (relative valuation lens)

- **WWI trades at ~0.45x EV/NPV**, mid-pack among developers with completed studies. This reflects South African jurisdiction risk and dilution concerns, but also near-term catalyst optionality.
- **TGM is the closest peer** (same jurisdiction, similar resource scale), but TGM's FS retraction makes direct comparison problematic.
- **AUC provides the cleaner benchmark** for what a DFS-stage developer "should" trade at in a low-risk jurisdiction (0.20x EV/NPV), implying WWI's SA discount is ~25 percentage points.
- **PDI shows what institutional backing can achieve** - larger scale, better jurisdiction (Guinea vs SA), trading at similar multiple to WWI despite being further from production.
- **Resource-scale EV/oz can look "cheap" for WWI** if you use the global WBP resource (especially including Inferred), because ounces are large. The **more honest cross-check** is whether those ounces are **convertible** (reserve + schedule + funding + jurisdiction + dilution).
- **Reserve-based EV/oz** puts WWI closer to producer-like territory (because the reserve is small vs EV), which is consistent with the market saying: "we'll pay for near-term ounces, not the whole 7.24Moz story yet."
- **Jurisdiction + cap-structure matters**: South Africa developers can trade at very low EV/oz until financing + permitting + construction credibility are clear; WWI's repeated equity issuance and large option/warrant stack increases the "developer discount".
