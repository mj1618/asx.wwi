### 5) Catalysts + timeline (next 6/12/24 months)
| Horizon | Expected catalyst | Why it matters | Dependency / gating item | Source to verify |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0–6 months | TBD | TBD | TBD | ASX announcement / quarterly |
| 6–12 months | TBD | TBD | TBD | Study / permit / financing docs |
| 12–24 months | TBD | TBD | TBD | Company guidance / project schedule |

### 6) Financial overview framework (focus: cash + dilution)
**Goal**: determine cash runway, burn rate, funding need timing, and dilution risk.

- **Historical cash flow** (use Appendix 5B/quarterly cashflow reports):
  - Operating cash flows (quarterly)
  - Exploration/evaluation spend
  - Development spend (if applicable)
  - Financing inflows (placements, options exercised, debt)
  - Ending cash balance

| Quarter | Operating CF | Investing/Exploration | Financing | Net change | Ending cash | Notes (one-offs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Qx YYYY | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

- **Runway & funding math** (template):
  - **Cash runway (quarters)** \(=\) Cash / Avg quarterly net cash outflow
  - **Implied funding date**: TBD
  - **Dilution sensitivity**: if raising \(X\) at price \(P\), new shares \(= X/P\)

### 7) Capital structure + dilution risk
- **Share count reconciliation**: beginning shares + issues – cancellations (TBD)
- **Options/warrants/convertibles**: strike, expiry, overhang (TBD)
- **Recent raises**: price, discount, investors, use of funds (TBD)
- **Director dealings**: signals + constraints (TBD)

### 8) Valuation approaches to use (mining-appropriate)
Use multiple lenses; triangulate.
- **Peer comps** (choose relevant stage peers):
  - EV / Resource (EV per oz or per tonne) where comparable
  - EV / Project NPV (if studies exist)
  - Market cap / Resource (early-stage, with caution)
- **NAV / DCF-style** (if development/production assumptions exist):
  - Production profile, recovery, capex/opex, sustaining capex, closure
  - Commodity price deck, FX, discount rate, tax/royalties
- **Real option framing** (early-stage exploration):
  - Milestone-based probability-weighted value

### 9) Peer set (to be finalized after asset clarity)
Define peer set by:
- commodity (gold / other)
- jurisdiction risk profile
- project stage (explorer / developer / producer)
- size (market cap and resource scale)

**Candidate peers (TBD)**:
- ASX-listed juniors with similar stage/commodity
- Comparable jurisdiction developers/explorers

### 10) Management, governance, and alignment
- **Board/management**:
  - Track record delivering projects, raises, M&A outcomes (TBD)
- **Alignment**:
  - Insider ownership, participation in raises, option incentives (TBD)
- **Governance**:
  - Related party transactions, remuneration, ESG/community strategy (TBD)

### 11) Risk register (track leading indicators)
| Risk | Why it matters | Likelihood (TBD) | Impact (TBD) | Mitigants | Leading indicators / watch items |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Permitting/regulatory delay | Timeline slip, value leakage | TBD | TBD | TBD | Permit milestones missed |
| Financing / dilution | Runway + cost of capital | TBD | TBD | TBD | Cash runway < 2–3 quarters |
| Commodity price / FX | Changes project economics | TBD | TBD | TBD | Price deck vs spot diverges |
| Execution / cost overrun | Capex blowouts | TBD | TBD | TBD | Study assumptions vs peers |
| Jurisdiction/community | Licence to operate | TBD | TBD | TBD | Community/legal disputes |
| Partner/JV risk | Misalignment on funding/work | TBD | TBD | TBD | JV disputes, earn-in delays |

### 12) Scenario table template (probability-weighted)
| Scenario | Probability (TBD) | Narrative | Key assumptions | Valuation method | Implied value / share price | What would change probability? |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Bull | TBD | TBD | TBD | Peer/NAV/Option | TBD | TBD |
| Base | TBD | TBD | TBD | Peer/NAV/Option | TBD | TBD |
| Bear | TBD | TBD | TBD | Liquidity / down-case | TBD | TBD |

### 13) Open questions (must verify from primary sources)
- What are WWI’s **current flagship assets** and exact ownership terms?
- What is the **latest cash balance** and quarterly **net cash burn**?
- Are there **near-term funding needs**? What instruments (equity/debt/streams)?
- What are the **next concrete catalysts** with dated milestones?
- Any material **legal/regulatory** issues (licences, disputes)?
- Any **related-party** items or governance red flags?
- What are management’s **track records** on similar projects?

### 14) Research workflow (how we’ll fill this)
- Pull primary documents listed in `sources.md`.
- Build a dated timeline of announcements and capital raises.
- Populate the financial/cap-structure tables from quarterly/annual filings.
- Identify the right peer set based on stage/commodity/jurisdiction.
- Populate scenarios with explicit assumptions and probability updates.
