  - Metallurgy/processing risk tied to toll-treatment pathway and schedule
  - Permitting/regulatory and local stakeholder risk in South Africa
  - Funding / dilution and debt covenant/availability risk during ramp to cashflow

#### B) Mt Cecilia Project (EL45/5045) — Paterson Province, Western Australia (100%)
- **Location**: Paterson Province, Western Australia (EL45/5045)
- **Interest / earn-in**: reported **100%** held by WWI
  - Company notes a prior **A$10m farm-in/JV** with **Rio Tinto Exploration Pty Ltd** to earn up to 80% (two-stage), but states **Stage-1 period expired Dec 2025** and Rio Tinto’s farm-in rights lapsed after spending ~A$1.5m vs A$4m requirement

  - Company flags exploration IUPs may no longer be within compliance period and could be subject to cancellation
- **Status**: no substantive activities; company seeking interested parties to divest
- **Key risks**: tenure validity/compliance, minority structure, political/regulatory, asset liquidity

### 4) Investment thesis (bull / base / bear)
- **Bull case** (what must be true):
  - Qala Shallows hits first gold and **ramps to sustained ~70koz p.a.** with **costs tracking the DFS** (AISC order-of-magnitude and schedule discipline).
  - Market assigns a higher multiple / lower discount to published DFS economics as de-risking milestones clear (production + cash generation).
  - Additional upside workstreams (e.g., Project 200 / resource conversion) progress without forcing excessive dilution.
- **Base case**:
  - Qala Shallows achieves first gold and ramps, but with typical commissioning/ramp “noise” (delays/variances) and continued reliance on capital markets for flexibility.
  - Valuation converges toward a discounted fraction of DFS project value as execution risk reduces.
- **Bear case**:
  - Material slippage vs first-gold/ramp schedule and/or poorer-than-expected grade/throughput/cost outcomes drives additional dilutive raises at lower prices.
  - Financing covenants / facility access / toll-treat execution frictions amplify downside; the market prices WWI as a stressed developer rather than a producer.
- **Variant view** (why WWI may be mispriced vs market consensus):
  - TBD

### 5) Catalysts + timeline (next 6/12/24 months)
| Horizon | Expected catalyst | Why it matters | Dependency / gating item | Source to verify |

### 6) Financial overview framework (focus: cash + dilution)
**Goal**: determine cash runway, burn rate, funding need timing, and dilution risk.

- **Historical cash flow** (use Appendix 5B/quarterly cashflow reports):
  - Operating cash flows (quarterly)
  - Exploration/evaluation spend
  - Development spend (if applicable)
  - Financing inflows (placements, options exercised, debt)
  - Ending cash balance

| Quarter | Operating CF | Investing/Exploration | Financing | Net change | Ending cash | Notes (one-offs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Q1 2024 (ended 31 Mar 2024) | (604) | (108) | 106 | (603) | 826 |  |
| Q2 2024 (ended 30 Jun 2024) | (671) | (58) | 1,304 | 576 | 1,401 | Placement noted in quarterly report (A$1.4m @ A$0.013; 107,692,308 shares) |
| Q3 2024 (ended 30 Sep 2024) | (815) | (120) | 1,490 | 556 | 1,957 | Financing includes A$1.5m convertible notes (see quarterly report text) |
| Q4 2024 (ended 31 Dec 2024) | (1,129) | (117) | 247 | (988) | 968 |  |
| Q1 2025 (ended 31 Mar 2025) | (629) | (216) | 30 | (812) | 156 |  |
| Q2 2025 (ended 30 Jun 2025) | (1,350) | (486) | 13,817 | 11,983 | 12,139 | Large equity financing inflow in quarter (see Appendix 5B financing section) |
| Q3 2025 (ended 30 Sep 2025) | (3,728) | (8,856) | 17,024 | 4,463 | 16,604 | Investing includes “Other” payment (USD 5.09m) for 10% minority buy-back (Appendix 5B note) |
| Q4 2025 (ended 31 Dec 2025) | (8,403) | (4,441) | 18,765 | 5,644 | 22,246 | Step-up in operating + investing outflows consistent with development spend; funding inflows via borrowings/financing |

- **Runway & funding math** (template):
  - **Latest quarter-ending cash** (31 Dec 2025): A$22.246m
  - **Simple runway estimate (quarters)**:
    - Using company’s Appendix 5B “estimated quarters of funding available” (item 8.7): **2.64 quarters** (as reported for quarter ended 31 Dec 2025)
    - Using (Operating CF + Investing CF) average over the last 2 quarters, excluding the Sep 2025 buy-back “Other” payment: \(\approx\) 2.5 quarters *(indicative; spend is ramping and includes one-offs)*
  - **Dilution sensitivity** (example math): if raising \(X\) at price \(P\), new shares \(= X/P\) (then adjust for attaching options if any)

### 7) Capital structure + dilution risk
- **Share count snapshot (post-placement quotation)**:
  - Ordinary shares (quoted): 4,319,419,767 (as at 2026-01-27)
  - Quoted options: 319,597,085 (as at 2026-01-27)
- **Options/warrants/convertibles (selected overhang disclosed in primary filings)**:
  - Unquoted options (aggregate): 171,088,599 (as at 2026-01-27)
  - Unquoted warrants: 166,933,764 (as at 2026-01-27) *(Nebari warrants referenced in quarterly report for quarter ended 31 Dec 2025)*
  - Convertible notes: 2 (as at 2026-01-27)
  - Performance rights: 5,000,000 (as at 2026-01-27)
- **Recent raises (equity)**:
  - 2025-09-15: A$17.5m placement; 437.5m shares @ A$0.04
  - 2026-01-20: A$27.5m placement; 343.75m shares @ A$0.08; attaching unlisted options (1 per 2 shares; A$0.11 exercise, 3-year expiry)
  - 2026-01-22: upsized placement to A$33.74m; 421.75m shares @ A$0.08; attaching unlisted options (1 per 2 shares; A$0.11 exercise, 3-year expiry)
- **Director dealings**: signals + constraints (TBD)
  - **Appendix 3Y highlights (primary)** — see `ownership.md`:
    - Aug 2025: directors participated in a placement at **A$0.022** (plus Executive Chair received shares in repayment of loan/interest).
    - Dec 2025 → Jan 2026: incentive **performance rights issued** (Dec) and then **exercised/vested into shares** (Jan) at **nil consideration**.

### 8) Valuation approaches to use (mining-appropriate)
Use multiple lenses; triangulate.
- **Peer comps** (choose relevant stage peers):
  - EV / Resource (EV per oz or per tonne) where comparable
  - EV / Project NPV (if studies exist)
  - Market cap / Resource (early-stage, with caution)
- **NAV / DCF-style** (if development/production assumptions exist):
  - Production profile, recovery, capex/opex, sustaining capex, closure
  - Commodity price deck, FX, discount rate, tax/royalties
- **Real option framing** (early-stage exploration):
  - Milestone-based probability-weighted value

### 9) Peer set (to be finalized after asset clarity)
Define peer set by:
- commodity (gold / other)
- jurisdiction risk profile
- project stage (explorer / developer / producer)
- size (market cap and resource scale)

**Candidate peers (initial; see `peers.md` for sources + caveats)**:
- **AU developers / early producers (stage comps)**:
  - **BGL** (Bellevue Gold) — high-grade underground; early producer; useful “quality producer” anchor.
  - **MEK** (Meeka Metals) — developer→producer transition; published DFS economics; dilution-cap-structure lens.
  - **OBM** (Ora Banda Mining) — WA producer/ramp; useful “ramp execution” comparison.
  - **STN** (Saturn Metals) — bulk-tonnage / heap-leach pathway; developer lens for low-grade projects.
  - **GMD** (Genesis Minerals) — consolidation-driven build-out; included as “developer rerate” example.
- **AU-listed Africa / SA exposure (jurisdiction discount comps)**:
  - **TGM** (Theta Gold Mines) — South Africa developer with BEE ownership complexity (closest structural analogue).
  - **WAF** (West African Resources) — Burkina Faso producer; “SSA but de-risked producer” anchor.
  - **PRU** (Perseus Mining) — multi-mine West Africa producer; “self-funding” counterexample.
  - **RSG** (Resolute Mining) — Africa producer + dev pipeline; provides project-NPV reference via Doropo DFS update.

### What comps imply vs current price (directional)
- **Resource-scale EV/oz can make WWI look “cheap”** if you use the large global MRE (especially including Inferred), but this mostly measures the market’s **discount-to-conversion** (reserve conversion + funding + ramp execution + jurisdiction + dilution), not “undervaluation”.
- **Reserve-based framing makes WWI look much less cheap** because the DFS reserve base is small relative to EV — consistent with the market saying: “pay for near-term mineable ounces, not the whole 7.24Moz story yet.”
- The most relevant near-term rerate trigger is still operational: **first gold + stable ramp**, because that’s what can move WWI from a “developer discount” toward more producer-like multiples (and reduce the market’s haircut to DFS/NAV anchors).

### 10) Management, governance, and alignment
- **Board + key management (latest captured: Annual Report FY2025)**:
  - | Person | Role (as disclosed) | Tenure / appointment notes | Why it matters (investor lens) |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Michael Quinert | Executive Chairman | In role during FY2025 (Directors’ Report dated 30 Sep 2025) | Key decision-maker; chair + executive chair structure concentrates influence. |
    | Rudi Deysel | CEO (from 1 Dec 2024) and MD (from 14 Jul 2025) | Operational lead into first-gold/ramp | Execution risk is highly “key-person” at this stage (ramp-to-cashflow). |
    | Jac van Heerden | Non-Executive Director | FY2025 | Mining engineer/operator background; also disclosed to have a small interest in the SA project company (see “Alignment”). |
    | Warwick Grigor | Non-Executive Director | FY2025 | Capital markets / mining finance experience; relevant to funding/dilution outcomes. |
    | Keith Middleton | Non-Executive Director | Appointed 14 Jul 2025 | Capital markets + growth-company execution; joined around transition to production. |
    | Simon Whyte | CFO + Joint Company Secretary | FY2025 | Financing, reporting, and governance cadence; also a material equity holder (see “Alignment”). |
    | Paul Godfrey | Joint Company Secretary | FY2025 | Corporate/legal governance support. |
- **Alignment (ownership + incentives, as disclosed in Annual Report FY2025)**:
  - **Director/KMP equity exposure (shares + options + performance rights)** is material at the margin (but small vs multi‑billion share count), and the company uses **options/performance rights** as a major component of LTI.
  - **Selected disclosed interests (Directors’ Report, FY2025 Annual Report)**:
    - Michael Quinert: **61.56m shares**, **7.02m options**, **5.0m performance rights**
    - Rudi Deysel: **6.35m shares**, **7.77m options**, **2.5m performance rights**
    - Jac van Heerden: **12.83m shares**, **7.54m options**, plus disclosed **right to 0.34% interest in West Wits MLI (Pty) Ltd**
    - Warwick Grigor: **26.48m shares**, **9.39m options**
    - Keith Middleton: **1.8m shares**, **4.5m options**
    - Simon Whyte (CFO): **15.82m shares**, **6.18m options**
  - **Performance-linked incentives (notable)**:
    - CEO performance rights include operational hurdles (e.g., **ore production rate** and **annualised gold production** milestones) which is directionally aligned with the near-term value driver (ramp).
  - **Director “skin in the game” via placements**:
    - FY2025 Annual Report notes **three directors** (Quinert, Grigor, van Heerden) agreed to subscribe **A$260k** in the **June 2025 placement**, subject to shareholder approval (approval received at an EGM on **11 Aug 2025** per annual report).
- **Governance / red flags (filing-supported observations)**:
  - **Related-party payments are non-trivial and should be monitored**:
    - FY2025 Annual Report discloses related-party transactions including legal fees to a director-related entity (QR Lawyers), rent to a director-related entity (Brickwick), legal fees to a director-related entity (Malan Scholes), and broker fees to a director-related entity (Far East Capital), plus a **loan from Kastin Pty Ltd** (director-related) disclosed at **A$100k** at 30 Jun 2025.
    - Latest quarterly (Dec 2025) reports **A$607k** related-party payments (Appendix 5B item 6.1), with narrative breakdown including director fees/salaries and payments to director-related entities for office rent/legal services.
  - **Capital structure governance matters**:
    - Meaningful **option/warrant overhang** (see Section 7) plus continuing issuance under incentive schemes (e.g., Jan 2026 Appendix 3G unquoted option issue).
  - **Auditor / assurance**:
    - Auditor is **William Buck** (per FY2025 Annual Report). Auditor report identifies **key audit matters** (exploration & evaluation asset carrying value; accounting for convertible notes). No “emphasis of matter” for going concern was identified in the captured FY2025 audit report text.
  - **Actionable watch-items (leading indicators)**:
    - Track **Appendix 5B item 6 related-party payments** each quarter; reconcile to disclosed related-party vendors and fee arrangements.
    - Track **director/KMP net buying/selling** once Appendix 3Y/3X extraction is built (leading indicator around funding events and ramp outcomes).
    - Track **new option/warrant issues** (Appendix 3G/2A/3B) and any **option term resets** (strike reductions/extensions).
    - Track **board/exec turnover** during the ramp-to-production window (key-person / continuity risk).
    - Track **substantial holder notices** (new control/influence dynamics; liquidity overhang risk).

### 11) Risk register (track leading indicators)
| Risk | Why it matters | Likelihood (TBD) | Impact (TBD) | Mitigants | Leading indicators / watch items |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Permitting/regulatory delay | Timeline slip, value leakage | TBD | TBD | TBD | Permit milestones missed |

| Substantial-holder sell-down / placement overhang | A large holder distributing stock can cap rallies and pressure liquidity; can dominate price action in small/mid caps | TBD | TBD | Transparent placement strategy; broaden register where possible | Form 603/604 notices; broker placement allocations; unusual volume + persistent weakness; top-20 % changes in reports |
| Register opacity / nominee-heavy concentration | Custodian/nominee lines obscure beneficial control and can mask “who is really selling/buying” | TBD | TBD | Better disclosure of strategic holders where possible; investor comms | Top-20 list composition (custodians); new nominee lines; sudden appearance/disappearance of a major line item |
| Governance / related-party spend | Conflicts + cash leakage perception can raise cost of capital and impair trust | TBD | TBD | Board policies; audit oversight; disclosure cadence | Appendix 5B item 6 trend; related-party balances in annual report; new related-party contracts |
| Incentive overhang / “cheap optionality” dilution | Options/warrants can cap rallies and create overhang; repeated issuance signals funding dependence | TBD | TBD | Clear incentive design; restrict resets; transparent cap-structure reporting | Appendix 2A/3B/3G frequency; term resets (strike/expiry); % of FD vs basic share count |
| Key-person / execution continuity | Transition to producer is highly execution-led; leadership disruption can cascade into schedule/cost issues | TBD | TBD | Depth in ops team; succession planning | Board/exec turnover; hiring pace; safety incidents; sustained delivery vs targets |
| Creditor / financier alignment | Debt facilities with equity-linked sweeteners can influence future dilution and covenant flexibility | TBD | TBD | Transparent facility terms; staged draws tied to milestones | New warrants/options to financiers; covenant disclosures; refinancing announcements |

### 12) Scenario table template (probability-weighted)
**Valuation anchor (primary)**: Qala Shallows DFS (2025-07-23) reports **post-tax NPV7.5 = US$500m** for the “All Mineral Resources” base case (includes Inferred), with **gold price sensitivity** down to **US$194m @ US$1,850/oz** and up to **US$1,111m @ US$4,850/oz**. WWI’s reported interest in WBP is **74%**.

**Dilution matters**: per-share outcomes depend as much on **share count growth** (funding path + option/warrant exercises) as on project value. Use both:
- **Basic shares**: 4,319,419,767 (2026-01-27)
- **Simple fully diluted (ex-convertibles)**: ~4,982,000,000 = basic + quoted options + unquoted options + warrants + perf rights (counts as at 2026-01-27)

Valuation method used below: **risked / discounted DFS NPV triangulation** + explicit **share-count (dilution) ranges**. This is intentionally “wide band” to avoid precision theatre.

**Back-of-envelope mapping used** (documented in more detail in `valuation.md`):
- Start with **attributable DFS NPV**: \(0.74 \times US\$500m\), then convert USD→AUD using a spot FX snapshot.
- Apply a scenario-specific **discount-to-NPV** factor (to reflect execution/jurisdiction/financing risk).
- Divide by an assumed **share count** (basic vs fully diluted vs “additional raise”).

| Scenario | Probability | Narrative (milestones + failure modes) | Funding / dilution assumption (2y) | Implied equity value range (AUD) | Implied value / share (AUD) | What would change probability? |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Bull | 25% | **First gold on time + clean ramp** toward ~70koz p.a.; market re-rates WWI from “developer” to “producer”; gold price supportive; expansion studies add optionality. **Failure modes**: ramp issues; processing/toll-treat friction; cost blowouts. | **Low additional dilution**: modest new equity; option exercises add cash (dilutive but not “distressed”). | ~A$620m–A$930m | ~A$0.14–A$0.22 (basic); ~A$0.12–A$0.19 (FD ex-CNs) | First gold achieved; early-grade reconciliation; evidence of stable deliveries + realised margins. |
| Base | 50% | **First gold achieved but ramp is bumpy** (typical variance); financing flexibility remains important; value moves toward a **discounted** DFS anchor as execution risk reduces. | **Moderate dilution**: additional raise(s) possible if ramp underdelivers; share count +20% to +60% vs current. | ~A$260m–A$470m | ~A$0.06–A$0.11 (basic); ~A$0.05–A$0.09 (FD ex-CNs) | Quarterly evidence of improving unit economics; reduced funding dependence; de-risking of toll-treat and logistics. |
| Bear | 25% | **Delays / cost overrun / grade issues** lead to **stressed funding** and equity raised at lower prices; market focuses on dilution + liquidity rather than DFS NPV. **Failure modes**: inability to sustain mining rate; covenant/credit access; regulatory/community issues. | **High dilution**: share count +60% to +150% vs current (or worse) and/or recap terms punitive. | ~A$60m–A$180m | ~A$0.01–A$0.04 (assuming materially higher share count) | Missed first-gold / ramp targets; rising quarterly cash burn; facility access constraints; repeated discounted placements. |

#### Probability-weighted outcome (what this implies)
Using the above scenario weights and midpoints, a coarse probability-weighted “intrinsic value” range lands around **high single-digits to low teens cents per share** (AUD), **before** accounting for any incremental dilution beyond the assumed bands.

#### 2-year downside probability (aligned to milestones)
The next ~24 months are dominated by “producer transition” milestones (first gold + ramp). A pragmatic way to frame the downside question (“chance it doesn’t go up / goes down”) is:
- **Downside drivers**: schedule slip vs first-gold; ramp underperformance; continued high burn forcing discounted equity; adverse operational surprises.
- Under the scenario weights above, a rough **2-year downside probability** is **~35–45%**, because even in the base case the stock can underperform if dilution dominates per-share outcomes.

### 13) Open questions (must verify from primary sources)
- What are WWI’s **current flagship assets** and exact ownership terms?
- What is the **latest cash balance** and quarterly **net cash burn**?
- Are there **near-term funding needs**? What instruments (equity/debt/streams)?
- What are the **next concrete catalysts** with dated milestones?
- Any material **legal/regulatory** issues (licences, disputes)?
- Any **related-party** items or governance red flags?
- What are management’s **track records** on similar projects?

### 14) Research workflow (how we’ll fill this)
- Pull primary documents listed in `sources.md`.
- Build a dated timeline of announcements and capital raises.
- Populate the financial/cap-structure tables from quarterly/annual filings.
- Identify the right peer set based on stage/commodity/jurisdiction.
- Populate scenarios with explicit assumptions and probability updates.
