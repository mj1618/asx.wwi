### 6) Financial overview framework (focus: cash + dilution)
**Goal**: determine cash runway, burn rate, funding need timing, and dilution risk.

- **Historical cash flow** (use Appendix 5B/quarterly cashflow reports):
  - Operating cash flows (quarterly)
  - Exploration/evaluation spend
  - Development spend (if applicable)
  - Financing inflows (placements, options exercised, debt)
  - Ending cash balance

| Quarter | Operating CF | Investing/Exploration | Financing | Net change | Ending cash | Notes (one-offs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Q1 2024 (ended 31 Mar 2024) | (604) | (108) | 106 | (603) | 826 |  |
| Q2 2024 (ended 30 Jun 2024) | (671) | (58) | 1,304 | 576 | 1,401 | Placement noted in quarterly report (A$1.4m @ A$0.013; 107,692,308 shares) |
| Q3 2024 (ended 30 Sep 2024) | (815) | (120) | 1,490 | 556 | 1,957 | Financing includes A$1.5m convertible notes (see quarterly report text) |
| Q4 2024 (ended 31 Dec 2024) | (1,129) | (117) | 247 | (988) | 968 |  |
| Q1 2025 (ended 31 Mar 2025) | (629) | (216) | 30 | (812) | 156 |  |
| Q2 2025 (ended 30 Jun 2025) | (1,350) | (486) | 13,817 | 11,983 | 12,139 | Large equity financing inflow in quarter (see Appendix 5B financing section) |
| Q3 2025 (ended 30 Sep 2025) | (3,728) | (8,856) | 17,024 | 4,463 | 16,604 | Investing includes “Other” payment (USD 5.09m) for 10% minority buy-back (Appendix 5B note) |
| Q4 2025 (ended 31 Dec 2025) | (8,403) | (4,441) | 18,765 | 5,644 | 22,246 | Step-up in operating + investing outflows consistent with development spend; funding inflows via borrowings/financing |

- **Runway & funding math** (template):
  - **Latest quarter-ending cash** (31 Dec 2025): A$22.246m
  - **Simple runway estimate (quarters)**:
    - Using company’s Appendix 5B “estimated quarters of funding available” (item 8.7): **2.64 quarters** (as reported for quarter ended 31 Dec 2025)
    - Using (Operating CF + Investing CF) average over the last 2 quarters, excluding the Sep 2025 buy-back “Other” payment: \(\approx\) 2.5 quarters *(indicative; spend is ramping and includes one-offs)*
  - **Dilution sensitivity** (example math): if raising \(X\) at price \(P\), new shares \(= X/P\) (then adjust for attaching options if any)

### 7) Capital structure + dilution risk

- **Director dealings**: signals + constraints (TBD)

### 8) Valuation approaches to use (mining-appropriate)
Use multiple lenses; triangulate.
- **Peer comps** (choose relevant stage peers):
  - EV / Resource (EV per oz or per tonne) where comparable
  - EV / Project NPV (if studies exist)
  - Market cap / Resource (early-stage, with caution)
- **NAV / DCF-style** (if development/production assumptions exist):
  - Production profile, recovery, capex/opex, sustaining capex, closure
  - Commodity price deck, FX, discount rate, tax/royalties
- **Real option framing** (early-stage exploration):
  - Milestone-based probability-weighted value

### 9) Peer set (to be finalized after asset clarity)
Define peer set by:
- commodity (gold / other)
- jurisdiction risk profile
- project stage (explorer / developer / producer)
- size (market cap and resource scale)

**Candidate peers (TBD)**:
- ASX-listed juniors with similar stage/commodity
- Comparable jurisdiction developers/explorers

### 10) Management, governance, and alignment
- **Board/management**:
  - Track record delivering projects, raises, M&A outcomes (TBD)
- **Alignment**:
  - Insider ownership, participation in raises, option incentives (TBD)
- **Governance**:

| Bull | TBD | TBD | TBD | Peer/NAV/Option | TBD | TBD |
| Base | TBD | TBD | TBD | Peer/NAV/Option | TBD | TBD |
| Bear | TBD | TBD | TBD | Liquidity / down-case | TBD | TBD |

### 13) Open questions (must verify from primary sources)
- What are WWI’s **current flagship assets** and exact ownership terms?
- What is the **latest cash balance** and quarterly **net cash burn**?
- Are there **near-term funding needs**? What instruments (equity/debt/streams)?
- What are the **next concrete catalysts** with dated milestones?
- Any material **legal/regulatory** issues (licences, disputes)?
- Any **related-party** items or governance red flags?
- What are management’s **track records** on similar projects?

### 14) Research workflow (how we’ll fill this)
- Pull primary documents listed in `sources.md`.
- Build a dated timeline of announcements and capital raises.
- Populate the financial/cap-structure tables from quarterly/annual filings.
- Identify the right peer set based on stage/commodity/jurisdiction.
- Populate scenarios with explicit assumptions and probability updates.
