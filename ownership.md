## Register concentration snapshots (primary)

| Snapshot date | What | Key data | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-09-26 | Top 20 ordinary shareholders | **Top 20 ordinary shareholders: ~43.50%** (snapshot “Shareholder information” in FY2025 annual report). | [WWI Annual Report (year ended 30 June 2025)](https://westwitsmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WWI-Annual-Report-End-June-2025.pdf) |

## Director / KMP dealing timeline (Appendix 3Y/3X/3Z)

This table focuses on **director/KMP disclosures** (Appendix 3Y etc.). It does **not** attempt to infer intent; where the filing states “nil consideration” the “price” column reflects that.

## Interpretation (evidence vs inference)

**Evidence (from filings above):**
- **Material register concentration** (Top 20 ~43.5% as at 26 Sep 2025), with custodians/nominees present (so “Top 20” ≠ necessarily beneficial owners).
- **Wingfield Durban Deep LP** was a **large initial substantial holder**: 12.46% on 2 Mar 2021 (Form 603). The FY2025 annual report later discloses Wingfield at 5.27% as at 26 Sep 2025 (but this repo does not yet capture Form 604 “change” notices between those dates).
- Over late-2025 / early-2026, the dominant “insider activity” visible in Appendix 3Y filings is **incentive issuance + vesting/exercise** (performance rights issued in Dec 2025; exercised into shares in Jan 2026), plus **director participation in a 2.2c placement** (Aug 2025).

**Inference (explicitly labelled):**
- A nominee-heavy top register can increase **opacity** (it’s harder to gauge true control and whether a “top 20” line is sticky or a custodian representing many small holders).
- If any previously-large holder continues selling down (e.g., Wingfield moving from 12.46% → 5.27%), that can create **liquidity/overhang** risk even if not visible day-to-day.
