## ASX:WWI (West Wits Mining Limited) — Primary sources checklist

**Rule of thumb**: prioritize primary documents (ASX filings, statutory filings, audited accounts). For every key claim, capture: **link + date + excerpt/claim supported**.

### Citation format (use everywhere)
- **[Document title](URL)** — *YYYY-MM-DD* — supports: “<claim>”

---

### 1) ASX market announcements (last 24 months minimum)
Goal: build a dated timeline of all material updates and capital structure changes.

- [ ] **All ASX announcements feed** (search by ticker and company name)
  - [ ] Quarterly activities reports
  - [ ] Appendix 5B (quarterly cashflow report)
  - [ ] Capital raises (placements/SPP/rights issues), Appendix 2A share issues
  - [ ] Options/warrants issues + cleansing notices
  - [ ] Project updates (drilling results, resource updates, studies, permits)
  - [ ] Acquisitions/disposals/JV agreements/terms sheets
  - [ ] Trading halts + reasons
  - [ ] Director interest notices (Appendix 3X/3Y/3Z)
  - [ ] Change of substantial holding (substantial holder notices)

Deliverable to build from this:
- [ ] **Announcement timeline table** (date, headline, category, key numbers, link)

---

### 2) Financial statements and periodic reports
- [ ] **Annual report (audited)** — latest FY
  - [ ] Notes on going concern, impairments, exploration & evaluation assets
  - [ ] Share-based payment notes (options, performance rights)
  - [ ] Related party disclosures
- [ ] **Half-year report** — latest (if applicable)
- [ ] **Quarterly cashflow reports (5B)** — last 8 quarters

Deliverables to build from this:
- [ ] Quarterly cashflow table (burn, exploration spend, ending cash)
- [ ] Capital structure reconciliation (shares/options movements)

---

### 3) Investor materials (company-provided)
- [ ] **Investor presentation / corporate deck** — latest version
- [ ] **Webinars / conference presentations** (slides + transcript if available)
- [ ] **Company website project pages** (capture claims, dates, disclaimers)

Notes:
- Investor decks often contain forward-looking assumptions; verify in filings where possible.

---

### 4) Project technical documents (where available)
Prioritize JORC-compliant and study documents.

- [ ] **JORC resource statements** (resource tables, assumptions, competent person)
- [ ] **Scoping / PFS / DFS** (if any)
  - [ ] Capex/opex/AISC assumptions and sensitivities
  - [ ] Mining method, metallurgy/recovery, schedule
  - [ ] Permitting status and critical path
- [ ] **Environmental / social / permitting docs** (government portals where possible)
- [ ] **JV / farm-in agreements** (terms, earn-in, obligations, dilution clauses)
- [ ] **Royalties/streams** (terms and counterparties)

---

### 5) Corporate governance and ownership
- [ ] **Board/management biographies** (track record verification items)
- [ ] **Corporate governance statement**
- [ ] **Top 20 shareholders** (from annual report / investor deck; verify currency)
- [ ] **Substantial holder notices** (ownership changes, institutions vs insiders)
- [ ] **Director dealings** (Appendix 3Y etc.)

Deliverables to build from this:
- [ ] Insider alignment summary (ownership, participation in raises, incentives)
- [ ] Governance red-flag checklist (related party, repeated raises, etc.)

---

### 6) External reference data (use for assumptions; keep it transparent)
- [ ] **Commodity prices** (gold/other as relevant): use one or two reputable references
- [ ] **FX rates** (AUD/USD, etc.)
- [ ] **Inflation / cost indices** (if modelling capex/opex escalation)
- [ ] **Comparable company market data** (peer EV, market cap, shares, resources)

Rule:
- Clearly state the source, date, and whether you used **spot** or a **price deck**.

---

### 7) News / media (secondary, for context only)
Use sparingly; confirm material facts via primary docs.

- [ ] Reputable financial press articles
- [ ] Interviews (treat as promotional unless corroborated)
